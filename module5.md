## üéØ Lab Objectives

## 2. Theory Overview

SageMaker Pipelines support modular ML workflows using built-in step types:

- `ProcessingStep`: for data cleaning, feature engineering, or validation  
- `TrainingStep`: for model training using built-in or custom estimators  
- `TransformStep`: for batch inference using trained models  
- Steps are connected using **property references**, which pass outputs from one step as inputs to another  
- Error handling can be implemented at the script level or using conditional logic in the pipeline
