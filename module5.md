# üß™ Lab 5.3: SageMaker Pipeline Orchestration and Workflow Management  
**Objective:** Understand how orchestration and workflow management are supported in SageMaker pipelines, and GitHub Actions can play a role in managing ML workflows‚Äîespecially when transitioning to Google Cloud Vertex AI.

---

## üîç Overview  

Amazon SageMaker Pipelines offer built-in orchestration for machine learning workflows. Each pipeline is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of steps such as data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployment. These steps are defined in Amazon Python SDK and executed in sequence based on their dependencies.

In conjuction with GitHub Actions can be used to orchestrate ML workflows outside of SageMaker‚Äîespecially when moving toward cloud-agnostic or Vertex AI‚Äìbased solutions. GitHub Actions provide a flexible, event-driven automation framework that can trigger pipeline runs, manage artifacts, and coordinate across environments.

---

## üß† Key Concepts to Explore  

### 5.3.1 ‚Äì Workflow Triggers and Automation  
- Understand how SageMaker pipelines are triggered manually or via SDK/API  
- Explore how GitHub Actions can automate pipeline execution based on events:
  - Code commits or pull requests  
  - Scheduled runs (cron jobs)  

### 5.3.2 ‚Äì Step Sequencing and Dependency Management  
- Learn how SageMaker uses step dependencies (`depends_on`) to enforce execution order  
- Explore how GitHub Actions uses `jobs` and `needs:` to define DAG-like workflows  
- Compare how both systems ensure reproducibility and traceability  

### 5.3.3 ‚Äì Parameterization and Environment Control  
- Review how SageMaker pipelines use `ParameterString`, `ParameterFloat`, etc.  
- Explore how GitHub Actions uses `env:` and `inputs:` to pass configuration across jobs  
- Discuss how environment-specific variables (e.g., dev/test/prod) are managed in both systems  

---

## ‚úÖ Outcomes  
By the end of this lab, learners will be able to:  
- Describe how SageMaker orchestrates ML workflows  
- Identify GitHub Actions features that support similar orchestration
