## 2. Theory Overview

SageMaker Pipelines are built as **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**, where each node represents a step and edges represent data dependencies.  

### 🔧 Core Step Types

| Step Type        | Purpose                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `ProcessingStep` | Preprocess or analyze data                   |
| `TrainingStep`   | Train a model using an estimator             |
| `TransformStep`  | Batch inference on new data                  |
| `ModelStep`      | Register trained model for deployment        |
| `ConditionStep`  | Branch logic based on metrics or thresholds  |
| `CallbackStep`   | Custom logic or external integrations        |

Next up: **Lab 5.2 – SageMaker Processing, Training, and Transform Steps**

# 🧪 Lab 5.2: SageMaker Processing, Training, and Transform Steps

**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Tools Required:** GitHub Training Repo

---

## 🎯 Lab Objectives

- Configure and implement `ProcessingStep`, `TrainingStep`, and `TransformStep` in a SageMaker Pipeline  
- Use step property references to enforce execution order and pass outputs between steps  
- Understand how artifacts flow through the pipeline DAG  
- Implement error handling and validation logic for robust pipeline execution  

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- Completion of Lab 5.1 (Pipeline architecture and component overview)  
- AWS account with SageMaker Studio or Notebook access  
- IAM role with `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess` and `AmazonS3FullAccess`  
- Python 3.8+ environment with `sagemaker` SDK installed  
- Access to the GitHub Training Repo containing starter pipeline code  
- Pre-created S3 bucket for input/output artifacts
- Pre-created Redshift Database Table

## 2. Theory Overview

SageMaker Pipelines support modular ML workflows using built-in step types:

- `ProcessingStep`: for data cleaning, feature engineering, or validation  
- `TrainingStep`: for model training using built-in or custom estimators  
- `TransformStep`: for batch inference using trained models  
- Steps are connected using **property references**, which pass outputs from one step as inputs to another  
- Error handling can be implemented at the script level or using conditional logic in the pipeline
