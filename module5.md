# üß™ Lab 5.3: SageMaker Pipeline Orchestration and Workflow Management  
**Objective:** Understand how orchestration and workflow management are supported in SageMaker pipelines, and GitHub Actions can play a role in managing ML workflows‚Äîespecially when transitioning to Google Cloud Vertex AI.

---

## üîç Overview  

Amazon SageMaker Pipelines offer built-in orchestration for machine learning workflows. Each pipeline is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of steps such as data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployment. These steps are defined in Amazon Python SDK and executed in sequence based on their dependencies.

In conjuction with GitHub Actions can be used to orchestrate ML workflows outside of SageMaker‚Äîespecially when moving toward cloud-agnostic or Vertex AI‚Äìbased solutions. GitHub Actions provide a flexible, event-driven automation framework that can trigger pipeline runs, manage artifacts, and coordinate across environments.

---

## üß† Key Concepts to Explore  

### 5.3.1 ‚Äì Workflow Triggers and Automation  
- Understand how SageMaker pipelines are triggered manually or via SDK/API  
- Explore how GitHub Actions can automate pipeline execution based on events:
  - Code commits or pull requests  
  - Scheduled runs (cron jobs)  

### 5.3.2 ‚Äì Step Sequencing and Dependency Management  
- Learn how SageMaker uses step dependencies (`depends_on`) to enforce execution order  
- Explore how GitHub Actions uses `jobs` and `needs:` to define DAG-like workflows  
- Compare how both systems ensure reproducibility and traceability  

### 5.3.3 ‚Äì Parameterization and Environment Control  
- Review how SageMaker pipelines use `ParameterString`, `ParameterFloat`, etc.  
- Explore how GitHub Actions uses `env:` and `inputs:` to pass configuration across jobs  
- Discuss how environment-specific variables (e.g., dev/test/prod) are managed in both systems  

---

## ‚úÖ Outcomes  
By the end of this lab, learners will be able to:  
- Describe how SageMaker orchestrates ML workflows

---

## 2. Theory Overview

Enterprise pipelines balance two forces:

- Template: Custom components for business-specific logic, rapid iteration, and fine-grained control  
- Template: Pre-built Google Cloud Pipeline Components for managed, standardized, scalable operations

Accelerator Template (3-layer) pattern:
- Infrastructure layer (Terraform): provisions Vertex AI resources, BigQuery, Feature Groups, IAM  
- Pipeline layer (KFP): custom + pre-built components and orchestration logic  
- Enterprise layer: Sysco governance, audit, compliance, and reusable Sysco solution well architected frameworks

BigQuery integration pattern used here:
- Use pre-built BigQuery Query Job components for serverless SQL-based preprocessing and deterministic AI ML train/test splits for descriminitive and generative models
- Use Feature Groups for feature governance, data drift, and data lineage from preprocessing, training, testing, evaluating, model registering, to online realtime inferencing, serving, and generative API endpoints.
- Consume shared views of BigQuery table artifacts in custom training/eval components eliminating data duplication persistant storage or temporary in-memory storage.

## ‚úÖ Lab 5.5.2 ‚Äî Pre-built Alternatives Exploration

Task: Review commented pre-built examples and capture trade-offs.

Files to open: vertex_pipeline_dev.py, vertex_pipeline_prod.py

Steps:
1. Search for `# TODO: Lab 5.5.2`.  
2. Locate commented pre-built examples (BigQuery Query Job, CustomTrainingJobOp, ModelUploadOp).  
3. For each custom component, write:
   - Pre-built alternative name  
   - 2 benefits of the pre-built approach  
   - 2 reasons the repo keeps/customizes the component

Deliverable: Short pros/cons list for each component pair (one paragraph each).

## ‚úÖ Lab 5.5.3 ‚Äî Accelerator Template Mapping

Task: Map pipeline files and infra to the 3-layer Accelerator Template.

Files to open: vertex_pipeline_dev.py, vertex_pipeline_prod.py, vertex_ai_infrastructure.tf, .github/workflows/vertex-ai-cicd.yml

Steps:
1. Search for `# TODO: Lab 5.5.3`.  
2. Identify concrete repo artifacts for each layer:
   - Infrastructure layer ‚Üí terraform file(s) and outputs (vertex_ai_infrastructure.tf)  
   - Pipeline layer ‚Üí vertex_pipeline_*.py and compiler.py  
   - Enterprise layer ‚Üí comments in prod pipeline, ModelUploadOp labels, recommended governance checks
3. Write a one-paragraph mapping for each layer listing filenames and the responsibilities they cover.

Deliverable: Three short paragraphs (one per layer) in feature branch.

## ‚úÖ Lab 5.5.4 ‚Äî BigQuery Integration, Artifact Typing, and Parameter Plumbing

Task: Trace how BigQuery outputs are produced, typed, and consumed by custom components.

Files to open: vertex_pipeline_dev.py, vertex_pipeline_prod.py, compiler.py, run_pipeline.py

Steps:
1. Search for `# TODO: Lab 5.5.4`.  
2. Confirm:
   - `bigquery_query_job_op` is loaded (components.load_component_from_url) and called for train/test queries.  
   - SQL uses `FARM_FINGERPRINT` for deterministic 80/20 splitting.  
   - BigQuery op outputs a BQ table artifact; code uses `Input[artifact_types.BQTable]`.  
   - Custom components parse `train_data.uri` (or metadata) to build `project.dataset.table` and read via `bigquery.Client`.  
   - Pipeline signature parameters (`bq_dataset`, `bq_view`, `project_id`, `region`) are passed through compiler/run scripts.
3. Compile the pipeline locally (example):
```bash
python compiler.py --py vertex_pipeline_dev.py --output pipelines/dev_diabetes_pipeline.yaml
```
4. Inspect the compiled YAML to confirm the BigQuery component output key name (`destination_table` or `destinationTable`) and note it.

Deliverable:
- Short dataflow bullets:
  BigQuery view ‚Üí bigquery_query_job_op (train/test) ‚Üí BQTable artifact ‚Üí train_model_op / evaluate_model_op (reads via BigQuery client) ‚Üí model artifacts
- Note: exact BigQuery output key from the compiled YAML and any mismatch to code usage.

Task: Explain how Feature Groups fit into the pipeline and propose governance checks to add.

Files to open: vertex_pipeline_dev.py, vertex_pipeline_prod.py, vertex_ai_infrastructure.tf

Steps:
1. Search for `# TODO: Lab 5.5.5`.  
2. Identify where pipeline queries a BigQuery view backed by Feature Groups and where Feature Registry is referenced in comments.  
3. Draft three practical governance actions to add in future labs (schema validation, data quality checks, drift monitoring) and where to place them in the pipeline (as components or monitoring jobs).

Deliverable: One-paragraph summary and a 3-item TODO checklist for governance tasks.

---

## Next: Lab 5.6 preview

Lab 5.6 will cover orchestration and Kubeflow integration:
- Compiling pipeline (compiler.py) and submitting via `PipelineJob` (`run_pipeline.py`) from local CLI and CI/CD

# üß™ Learner Guide ‚Äî Labs 5.7, 5.8, and 5.9: Vertex AI Pipeline Conversion and Validation

**Session Type:** Explore-only (2 hours)  
**Tools Required:** PyCharm or VS Code, GitHub Training Repo with conversion file  
**File to Open:**  
- `train_to_vertex_ai_conversion.py`

---

## üß† Overview

This guided exploration focuses on understanding how a traditional ML training script (`train.py`) is converted into a Vertex AI pipeline using Kubeflow components. No execution or documentation is required ‚Äî your goal is to read, reason, and locate the `# TODO: Lab X.Y.Z` markers embedded in the single consolidated conversion file.

---

## üéØ Lab Objectives

### Lab 5.7: General ML train.py ‚Üí Vertex AI Pipeline Conversion Workshop  
**Focus:** High-level line-by-line exploration

- Understand how each import, parameter, and execution pattern in `train.py` maps to Vertex pipeline components  
- Compare script-style execution to DAG-based orchestration  
- Trace argparse usage and its replacement with pipeline parameters

### Lab 5.8: Component Mapping and Functionality Translation  
**Focus:** Function-by-function deep dive

- Map each function in `train.py` to its corresponding Vertex component  
- Explore how CSV-based logic is replaced by BigQuery artifacts  
- Verify algorithm consistency and artifact persistence

### Lab 5.9: Pipeline Testing and Validation Framework  
**Focus:** Quality gates and testing patterns

- Understand how conditional logic replaces always-register behavior  
- Explore metrics-driven approval and rejection paths  
- Review transformation patterns that support enterprise-grade monitoring

---

## üìö Theory Summary

Vertex AI pipelines use declarative DAGs with typed artifacts, structured Metrics, and conditional branching. Migration replaces file-based I/O with cloud-native services (BigQuery), wraps logic in components, and introduces observability and quality gates while keeping core algorithm code largely unchanged.
