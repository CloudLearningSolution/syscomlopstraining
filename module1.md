- When is usage the highest?
- Any idle periods or unnecessary resources?
- Ratio between training and inference costs?

---

### Step 1.3: Advanced Cost Analysis Techniques (20 minutes)

#### 1. Usage Pattern Analysis

**Important**: Enabling hourly granularity can take up to 48 hours to populate data. For hourly-level data, we charge $0.01 per 1,000 usage records monthly.

**Note**: This is optional but may not be available for all accounts.

- Switch to **Hourly** granularity for the recent week
- Detect peak usage periods and idle patterns
- Switch back to **Daily** to document seasonal behavior
- Use **Amazon Q Developer** for insights like:
  - ‚ÄúWhich region had the largest cost increase last month?‚Äù

#### 2. Explore Additional Filters

Try filters for:

- **Region**: Concentration of activity
- **Usage Type**: (e.g., ml.t3.medium)


#### 3. Cost Anomaly Detection Review

**New Feature:** Cost Anomaly Detection enabled by default (as of March 2025)

- In the AWS Console **Search Bar**, type **Cost Anomaly Detection**
- Select the service
- Select **Get started**, and take the tour if available. Do not create a new cost monitor. If needed, cancel to return to the main dashboard.
- Review existing **detected anomalies** and **cost anomaly detection summary**.
- Click into **cost monitors** and **Alert subscriptions** to review existing configurations.
- Document findings

üí° Pro Tip: Idle weekends or underutilized resources are low-hanging fruit for cost cuts.
