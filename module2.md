# MLOPS Model Migration Workshop â€“ Week 2: Core Architecture - Hands-On Workshop

---

## Module Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

- Compare and contrast AWS and Google Cloud global infrastructure architectures
- Explore topologies across both platforms
- Map AWS services to Google Cloud service equivalents for AI/ML pipeline workloads

---

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1: Cost Optimization
- AWS Management Console access with infrastructure permissions
- Google Cloud Console access with project access rights

---

## Workshop Overview

This hands-on workshop builds upon the cost management foundation from Module 1 to establish the technical architecture knowledge required for successful AWS to Google Cloud ML migrations. Using **console interfaces** and **CloudShell**, participants will gain practical experience with infrastructure services, networking, and IAM configurations across both platforms.

## Module 1: AWS Global Infrastructure and Core Resources

# ðŸ§ª Lab 2.1: AWS Regions and Availability Zones Architecture Deep Dive

**Duration:** 45 minutes
**Objective:** Explore AWS global infrastructure and availability zone design using CLI and console-based inspectionâ€”without finalizing resource creation.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- AWS Management Console access with EC2 and CloudShell permissions

- AWS CLI available via CloudShell or local environment

- Familiarity with basic AWS terminology (Region, AZ, CLI)

- No EC2 instance creation required

---

## 2. Theory Overview

- AWS infrastructure is organized into regions and availability zones

- Each region is a geographically isolated location with multiple AZs

- Availability Zones are independent failure domains within a region

- Opt-in regions must be manually enabled before use

- High availability strategies use multiple AZs to ensure fault tolerance

---

## 3. Hands-On Exploration Steps (Do Not Finalize Resources)

### 10. Access AWS Console

- Navigate to [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com)

- Launch CloudShell from the top navigation bar

### 11. Explore Available Regions

- Run: `aws ec2 describe-regions --output table`

- Run: `aws ec2 describe-regions --query 'Regions[*].[RegionName,OptInStatus]' --output table`

- Identify which regions require opt-in

### 12. Explore Availability Zones

- Run: `aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --output table`

- Run: `aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --region us-east-1 --output table`

- Observe zone names and states

### 13. Inspect Region Selector in EC2 Console

- Navigate to **EC2 > Instances > Launch Instance**

- Use the region dropdown to compare AZ counts

- Cancel before launching any instance

### 14. Sketch Region-to-Zone Mapping

- Identify 3 regions and list their AZs

- Note differences in zone naming and availability

---

## 4. Deliverables

- Table of AWS Regions and Opt-In status

- List of AZs for `us-east-1` and two other regions

# ðŸ§ª Lab 2.2: AWS Edge Locations and CloudFront Global Network Exploration

**Duration:** 45 minutes
**Objective:** Explore AWSâ€™s global content delivery infrastructure using CloudFront and edge location metadataâ€”without deploying distributions or modifying resources.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- AWS Management Console access with CloudFront and CloudShell permissions

- AWS CLI available via CloudShell or local environment

- Basic understanding of CDN concepts (edge location, origin, cache)

- No CloudFront distribution creation required

---

## 2. Theory Overview

- AWS CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that uses a global network of edge locations

- Edge locations cache content closer to users to reduce latency

- Regional edge caches act as mid-tier caches between origin and edge locations

- CloudFront integrates with other AWS services like S3, EC2, and Lambda@Edge

- Edge locations are distributed across major cities and regions worldwide

---

## 3. Hands-On Exploration Steps (Do Not Finalize Resources)

### 10. Access AWS Console

- Navigate to [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com)

- Launch CloudShell from the top navigation bar

### 11. Explore Edge Location Metadata

- Run: `aws cloudfront list-distributions --output json`

- If no distributions exist, proceed to inspect global infrastructure

- Run: `aws cloudfront get-distribution-config --id <distribution-id>` (only if read-only distributions exist)

### 12. Review Global Edge Network

- Navigate to **CloudFront > Locations** in AWS Console

- Observe map of edge locations and regional edge caches

- Note geographic distribution and latency zones

### 13. Inspect CloudFront Console

- Navigate to **CloudFront > Distributions**

- Select any existing distribution (if available)

- Review origin settings, cache behaviors, and edge associations

- Do not create or modify any distributions

### 14. Compare Edge Location Coverage

- Identify 3 cities with edge locations from the AWS map

- Note proximity to major user populations

- Record latency benefits and strategic placement rationale

---
