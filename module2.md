- Explore topologies across both platforms
- Map AWS services to Google Cloud service equivalents for AI/ML pipeline workloads

---

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1: Cost Optimization
- AWS Management Console access with infrastructure permissions
- Google Cloud Console access with project access rights

---

## Workshop Overview

This hands-on workshop builds upon the cost management foundation from Module 1 to establish the technical architecture knowledge required for successful AWS to Google Cloud ML migrations.

## Module 1: AWS Global Infrastructure and Core Resources

# ðŸ§ª Lab 2.1: AWS Regions and Availability Zones Architecture Deep Dive

**Duration:** 45 minutes
**Objective:** Explore AWS global infrastructure and availability zone design using CLI and console-based inspectionâ€”without finalizing resource creation.
