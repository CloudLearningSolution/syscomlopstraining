# üß™ Lab 3.1: AWS Management Console IAM Configuration for SageMaker

**Objective:** Explore the IAM roles, trust relationships, and managed policies that enable Amazon SageMaker‚Äîwithout creating or modifying any IAM resources.
---

## 1. Prerequisites

- AWS Management Console access with IAM ‚ÄúReadOnly‚Äù and SageMaker permissions  

- Familiarity with AWS IAM concepts (roles, policies, trust relationships)  

- No new IAM role or policy creation allowed  

---

## 2. Theory Overview

- SageMaker uses an execution role to call other AWS services on your behalf (S3, ECR, CloudWatch, etc.)  

- Execution roles require a trust policy allowing the SageMaker service principal (`sagemaker.amazonaws.com`) to assume the role  

- Common managed policies include `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess` and `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`  

- The `iam:PassRole` permission is required to pass execution roles into SageMaker jobs

## 3. Hands-On Exploration Steps (Do Not Finalize Resources)

### 10. Open the IAM Console

- Search for IAM, and then select **Roles**  

- Search for **AmazonSageMaker** in the Roles list  

### 11. Review an Existing SageMaker Execution Role

- Click a role named like `AmazonSageMaker-ExecutionRole-*`  

- Select the **Trust relationships** tab  

- Confirm `Service: sagemaker.amazonaws.com` under **Trusted entities**  

### 12. Inspect Attached Policies

- Select the **Permissions** tab  

- Note managed policies such as `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess`

- Click **Policy name** ‚Üí **JSON** to view actions and resources  
---

## 4. Deliverables

- List of SageMaker execution roles and their trust principals  

- Summary of key managed policies and granted actions

## 5. Supplemental Materials

- IAM Roles for SageMaker Overview

- SageMaker Execution Role Best Practices  
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/build-and-manage-access.html  

---

## 6. Notes and Warnings

- Do not create, modify, or delete any IAM roles or policies  

- Viewing trust relationships and policies is read-only  

- Passing real roles without proper review can break production workflows  

---

## 7. Verification Source

- Verified against AWS SageMaker IAM documentation  
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/security_iam_service-with-iam.html
