# üß™ Lab 4.4: Google Cloud VPC Design and Implementation for Vertex AI
 
**Objective:** Design and configure a secure VPC environment that enables Vertex AI pipeline components to access Google Cloud Storage and BigQuery using Private Google Access‚Äîwithout relying on external IPs or public internet routing.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- Google Cloud Console access with Compute Network Admin and Vertex AI Admin roles  
- Vertex AI API enabled  
- Cloud Workstations  
- Existing Vertex AI pipeline deployed  

---

## 2. Theory Overview

- **Private Google Access** allows managed resources in private subnets to access Google APIs (e.g., GCS, BigQuery) without external IPs  
- **Vertex AI pipeline components** often run on managed infrastructure that uses internal IPs only  
- Enabling Private Google Access ensures secure, compliant access to datasets, models, and metadata stored in GCS and BigQuery  
- This configuration is critical for components like `preprocess_data_op`, `train_model_op`, `evaluate_model_op`, `model_approved_op`, and `register_model_op`  
- The only component that does not require GCS access is `model_rejected_op`  

---

## 3. Hands-On Implementation Steps

## Overview

These labs teach you how to configure Private Google Access so your Vertex AI pipeline components can securely access Cloud Storage and BigQuery without using the public internet.

### Pipeline Components That Need Access

| Component | What It Does | Needs GCS/BigQuery? |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| `preprocess_data_op` | Downloads raw data | ‚úÖ Yes - Direct GCS access |
| `train_model_op` | Trains the model | ‚úÖ Yes - Reads/writes artifacts |
| `evaluate_model_op` | Evaluates model performance | ‚úÖ Yes - Reads data, writes metrics |
| `model_approved_op` | Logs approved models | ‚úÖ Yes - Reads model metadata |
| `register_model_op` | Registers model version | ‚úÖ Yes - Reads artifact paths |
| `model_rejected_op` | Logs rejection | ‚ùå No - Only logging |

---

## üß™ Lab 4.4: Google Cloud VPC Design and Implementation for Vertex AI

**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Objective:** Build a private VPC that lets your existing Vertex AI pipeline components reach Cloud Storage and BigQuery over Google's internal network by enabling Private Google Access.

---

### 1. Prerequisites

- Project Owner or Compute Network Admin & Vertex AI Admin  
- Vertex AI, Cloud Storage & BigQuery APIs enabled  
- Cloud Shell or local `gcloud` CLI authenticated  
- An existing Vertex AI pipeline deployed (or pipeline spec in hand)  
- Pipeline service account granted `roles/storage.objectViewer`/`Admin` and BigQuery Data Viewer/Editor  

---

### 2. Theory Overview

**Private Google Access** allows managed resources and managed infrastructure in a **private subnet** (no external IP) to call Google APIs (e.g., `storage.googleapis.com`, `bigquery.googleapis.com`) on Google's private backbone.

Vertex AI pipeline steps run on managed VMs or GKE pods without external IPs. Enabling Private Google Access ensures your pipeline can:
- Download raw data (`preprocess_data_op`)  
- Read/write model artifacts (`train_model_op`, `evaluate_model_op`, `model_approved_op`, `register_model_op`)  
- Query BigQuery datasets for features or logging  

The only step that does **not** need GCS/BigQuery is `model_rejected_op` (logging only).

---

### 3. Hands-On Implementation Steps

#### 3.1 Create a Custom VPC

# Important: The presenter will create a VPC. Participants will create subnets and enable private google access.
```bash
gcloud compute networks create vertex-ai-vpc \
--subnet-mode=custom
```

**What this does:**
- Creates a new VPC network named `vertex-ai-vpc`
- Uses `custom` subnet mode for full control over IP ranges
- No subnets are created automatically

#### 3.2 Create a Subnet with Private Google Access

**For Training Participants:** Each participant will create their own unique subnet. Use your assigned participant number (1-40) in the commands below.

```bash
# Replace XX with your participant number (01-40)
# For example: participant 1 uses "01", participant 15 uses "15"

gcloud compute networks subnets create vertex-ai-subnet-participant-XX \
--network=vertex-ai-vpc \
--region=us-east1 \
--range=10.10.XX.0/24 \
--enable-private-ip-google-access
```

**Participant IP Range Assignments:**

| Participant | Subnet Name | IP Range | Available IPs |
|------------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 01 | vertex-ai-subnet-participant-01 | 10.10.1.0/24 | 254 |
| 02 | vertex-ai-subnet-participant-02 | 10.10.2.0/24 | 254 |
| 03 | vertex-ai-subnet-participant-03 | 10.10.3.0/24 | 254 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 15 | vertex-ai-subnet-participant-15 | 10.10.15.0/24 | 254 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 40 | vertex-ai-subnet-participant-40 | 10.10.40.0/24 | 254 |

**Example for Participant 7:**
```bash
gcloud compute networks subnets create vertex-ai-subnet-participant-07 \
--network=vertex-ai-vpc \
--region=us-east1 \
--range=10.10.7.0/24 \
--enable-private-ip-google-access
```

**What this does:**
- Creates a unique subnet for each participant in the shared VPC
- Each participant gets their own /24 subnet (254 usable IPs)
- Non-overlapping IP ranges prevent conflicts
- **Enables Private Google Access** - the key setting for this lab!

**Important Notes:**
- The VPC (`vertex-ai-vpc`) is shared by all participants
- Each participant creates and manages their own subnet
- IP ranges are pre-assigned to avoid conflicts
- All subnets have Private Google Access enabled

#### 3.3 Verify Private Google Access

```bash
gcloud compute networks subnets describe vertex-ai-subnet-participant-XX \
--region=us-east1 \
--format="get(privateIpGoogleAccess)"
```

**Expected output:** `True`

This confirms that VMs in this subnet can reach Google APIs without external IPs.

#### 3.4 Configure ML Pipeline to Use Your VPC
---
# Important: Presenter will demonstrate how the ML pipeline orchestration utilizes your private subnetwork with private google access.

### 5. Pipeline Component Access Matrix

| Component | GCS Access | BigQuery Access | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|-------|
| `preprocess_data_op` | Direct | Optional | Uses google-cloud-storage client |
| `train_model_op` | Indirect | Optional | Kubeflow reads/writes model artifacts |
| `evaluate_model_op` | Indirect | Optional | Reads dataset/model, writes metrics |
| `model_approved_op` | Indirect | Optional | Reads model URI for logging |
| `register_model_op` | Indirect | Optional | Reads artifact URI for Model Registry |
| `model_rejected_op` | None | None | Logging only; no GCS/BigQuery interaction |

# üß™ Lab 4.5: Firewall Rules and Network Security for ML Workloads

## Objective: Lock down egress on your Vertex AI pipeline‚Äôs VPC so it can still reach Google APIs (Cloud Storage, BigQuery) and the metadata server, while blocking all other outbound traffic.

#### 1. Prerequisites
- Compute Security Admin role granted

- Completion of Lab 4.4 (custom subnet with Private Google Access)

- Cloud Shell or local gcloud CLI authenticated

#### 2. Theory Overview
- Google Cloud firewalls are stateful and enforced at the VPC level.

- By default, all egress is allowed, which increases risk.

- For least-privilege, restrict egress to only:

- Google APIs (*.googleapis.com over TCP/443)

- Metadata server (169.254.169.254 for token exchange)

- DNS (udp/tcp:53) for name resolution

#### 3. Hands-On Implementation Steps

3.1 (Optional) Tag Your Pipeline Infrastructure

- Governance which includes tagging is covered later in the 32 week course.

#### Note: In the next steps replace the variables "XX" and "X" with your participant number. For example, participant-07 and --source-ranges=10.10.7.0/24.

3.2 Allow Egress to Google APIs
```bash
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-egress-google-apis-participant-XX \
  --network=vertex-ai-vpc \
  --direction=EGRESS \
  --action=ALLOW \
  --rules=tcp:443 \
  --destination-ranges=199.36.153.4/30,199.36.153.8/29 \
  --source-ranges=10.10.X.0/24 \
  --priority=1000 \
  --description="Allow egress to Google APIs from participant XX"
```
3.3 Allow Egress to Metadata Server
```bash
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-egress-metadata-XX \
  --network=vertex-ai-vpc \
  --direction=EGRESS \
  --action=ALLOW \
  --rules=tcp:80 \
  --destination-ranges=169.254.169.254/32 \
  --source-ranges=10.10.X.0/24 \
  --priority=900 \
  --description="Allow egress to GCE metadata server from participant XX"
```
3.4 Allow Egress for DNS Resolution
```bash
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-egress-dns-XX \
  --network=vertex-ai-vpc \
  --direction=EGRESS \
  --action=ALLOW \
  --rules=udp:53,tcp:53 \
  --destination-ranges=0.0.0.0/0 \
  --source-ranges=10.10.X.0/24 \
  --priority=800 \
  --description="Allow DNS resolution from participant XX"
```
3.5 Deny All Other Egress
```bash
gcloud compute firewall-rules create deny-egress-all-participant-XX \
  --network=vertex-ai-vpc \
  --direction=EGRESS \
  --action=DENY \
  --rules=all \
  --destination-ranges=0.0.0.0/0 \
  --source-ranges=10.10.X.0/24 \
  --priority=65534 \
  --description="Deny all other outbound traffic from participant XX"
```
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This denies everything else. Ensure your pipeline only needs the above services. This will also DENY python pip!

# Private Services Access vs Private Google Access

## Overview

Private Google Access and Private Services Access both keep traffic off the public internet, but they operate at different layers and serve different use cases.  

---

## Private Google Access

- Enabled on a subnet with `--enable-private-ip-google-access`  
- Allows ML pipeline components and managed services in a private subnet to call Google APIs (Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Vertex AI) over Google‚Äôs internal network  
- No peering or IP allocation required  
- Covers ‚Äúpublic‚Äù Google services endpoints like `storage.googleapis.com` and `bigquery.googleapis.com`  

---

## Private Services Access

- Creates a dedicated VPC peering connection to a Google-managed service network (service producer)  
- Requires you to:
  - Reserve an internal IP range for the service producer  
  - Use the Service Networking API to establish peering  
- Enables private-IP connectivity to managed services with private-instance backends (Cloud SQL, Memorystore, GKE private control planes)  
- Traffic remains on Google‚Äôs backbone but uses internal RFC-1918 addresses  

---

## Manual Peering vs Private Services Access

- Private Services Access leverages the same VPC peering mechanism, but:

- The ‚Äúproducer‚Äù VPC is owned and managed by Google for a specific service  
- You don‚Äôt manually create peering routes; Service Networking automates route and tenancy-unit setup  
- Peering is one-way from your VPC to the service producer‚Äôs VPC, but appears in your network as a standard peering connection  

---

## When to Use Each

| Capability               | Use Case                                                         |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Private Google Access    | Access Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Vertex AI APIs without external IPs |
| Private Services Access  | Access private-IP services (Cloud SQL, Memorystore, GKE private)   |

---

#### 3. Hands-On Implementation Steps

- Service Networking API enabled:

```bash
  gcloud services enable servicenetworking.googleapis.com
```
##### 3.1 Reserve a Peering IP Range

## Strategy for All 40 + Participants

| Participant | Range Name                 | IP Block        |
|-------------|----------------------------|-----------------|
| 01          | memorystore-psa-range-01   | 10.20.1.0/24    |
| 02          | memorystore-psa-range-02   | 10.20.2.0/24    |
| ...         | ...                        | ...             |
| 40          | memorystore-psa-range-40   | 10.20.40.0/24   |


- Reserve a /16 range in your VPC for Memorystore‚Äôs private endpoints:
```bash
gcloud compute addresses create memorystore-psa-range-XX \
  --global \
  --purpose=VPC_PEERING \
  --addresses=10.20.X.0 \
  --prefix-length=24 \
  --network=vertex-ai-vpc \
  --description="Participant XX IP range for Private Services Access to Memorystore"
```
- *The command with --prefix-length=24 lets Google Cloud automatically allocate a free /24 block from the default internal ranges*
- *To explicitly assign a known IP block like 10.20.7.0/24, each participant must use the --addresses flag*
- *--prefix-length=24 defines the size of the block (256 IPs)*
- **Ensures predictable, non-overlapping IP allocation across participants**

##### What you have accomplished
- Creates a global internal IP range for VPC peering with Google‚Äôs service producer network.

- Scopes it to vertex-ai-vpc, ensuring the participant‚Äôs ML VPC can privately connect to Memorystore or Cloud SQL, etc.

- Uses a /24 block, which is ideal for isolated environments with up to 256 IPs to support multiple instances running managed services per participant.

##### 3.2 Establish Service Networking Peering

- Presenter Hands-On Example
```bash
gcloud services vpc-peerings connect \
  --service=servicenetworking.googleapis.com \
  --network=vertex-ai-vpc \
  --ranges=memorystore-psa-range-01
```

- Participant Hands-On
- Peer your VPC to the Memorystore service producer:
```bash
gcloud services vpc-peerings update \
  --service=servicenetworking.googleapis.com \
  --network=vertex-ai-vpc \
  --ranges=memorystore-psa-range-XX,memorystore-psa-range-01
```

##### 3.3 Verify the Peering Connection
- List peering connections on your VPC:
```bash
gcloud compute networks peerings list \
  --network=vertex-ai-vpc
```

- Expected state: ACTIVE

##### Key Documentation Insights

- Only one private connection is needed per VPC, even if multiple services or IP ranges are used.

- The service producer network is dedicated per project, and your VPC peers into it using the Service Networking API.

###### Private Google Access and Private Services Access are independent features:

- Private Google Access is subnet-level and enables access to Google APIs.

- Private Services Access is VPC-level and enables access to private IP services like Cloud SQL or Memorystore.
