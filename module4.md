# üß™ Lab 4.1: AWS VPC Design and Implementation for SageMaker

**Objective:** Understand how Amazon SageMaker integrates with Amazon VPCs to isolate ML workloads and enable secure communication with AWS services.

---

- Familiarity with basic VPC concepts: subnets, route tables, security groups  

---

## 2. Theory Overview

- SageMaker domains can be configured to run in **VPC-only mode** for full network isolation  
- You must specify subnets, security groups, and optionally VPC endpoints for services like S3 and CloudWatch  
- VPC-only mode disables public internet access and routes all traffic through your defined VPC

# üß™ Lab 4.4: Google Cloud VPC Design and Implementation for Vertex AI
 
**Objective:** Design and configure a secure VPC environment that enables Vertex AI pipeline components to access Google Cloud Storage and BigQuery using Private Google Access‚Äîwithout relying on external IPs or public internet routing.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- Google Cloud Console access with Compute Network Admin and Vertex AI Admin roles  
- Vertex AI API enabled  
- Cloud Workstations  
- Existing Vertex AI pipeline deployed  

---

## 2. Theory Overview

- **Private Google Access** allows managed resources in private subnets to access Google APIs (e.g., GCS, BigQuery) without external IPs  
- **Vertex AI pipeline components** often run on managed infrastructure that uses internal IPs only  
- Enabling Private Google Access ensures secure, compliant access to datasets, models, and metadata stored in GCS and BigQuery  
- This configuration is critical for components like `preprocess_data_op`, `train_model_op`, `evaluate_model_op`, `model_approved_op`, and `register_model_op`  
- The only component that does not require GCS access is `model_rejected_op`  

---

## 3. Hands-On Implementation Steps

## Overview

These labs teach you how to configure Private Google Access so your Vertex AI pipeline components can securely access Cloud Storage and BigQuery without using the public internet.

### Pipeline Components That Need Access

| Component | What It Does | Needs GCS/BigQuery? |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| `preprocess_data_op` | Downloads raw data | ‚úÖ Yes - Direct GCS access |
| `train_model_op` | Trains the model | ‚úÖ Yes - Reads/writes artifacts |
| `evaluate_model_op` | Evaluates model performance | ‚úÖ Yes - Reads data, writes metrics |
| `model_approved_op` | Logs approved models | ‚úÖ Yes - Reads model metadata |
| `register_model_op` | Registers model version | ‚úÖ Yes - Reads artifact paths |
| `model_rejected_op` | Logs rejection | ‚ùå No - Only logging |

---

## üß™ Lab 4.4: Google Cloud VPC Design and Implementation for Vertex AI

**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Objective:** Build a private VPC that lets your existing Vertex AI pipeline components reach Cloud Storage and BigQuery over Google's internal network by enabling Private Google Access.

---

### 1. Prerequisites

- Project Owner or Compute Network Admin & Vertex AI Admin  
- Vertex AI, Cloud Storage & BigQuery APIs enabled  
- Cloud Shell or local `gcloud` CLI authenticated  
- An existing Vertex AI pipeline deployed (or pipeline spec in hand)  
- Pipeline service account granted `roles/storage.objectViewer`/`Admin` and BigQuery Data Viewer/Editor  

---

### 2. Theory Overview

**Private Google Access** allows managed resources and managed infrastructure in a **private subnet** (no external IP) to call Google APIs (e.g., `storage.googleapis.com`, `bigquery.googleapis.com`) on Google's private backbone.

Vertex AI pipeline steps run on managed VMs or GKE pods without external IPs. Enabling Private Google Access ensures your pipeline can:
- Download raw data (`preprocess_data_op`)  
- Read/write model artifacts (`train_model_op`, `evaluate_model_op`, `model_approved_op`, `register_model_op`)  
- Query BigQuery datasets for features or logging  

The only step that does **not** need GCS/BigQuery is `model_rejected_op` (logging only).

---

### 3. Hands-On Implementation Steps

#### 3.1 Create a Custom VPC

# Important: The presenter will create a VPC. Participants will create subnets and enable private google access.
```bash
gcloud compute networks create vertex-ai-vpc \
--subnet-mode=custom
```

**What this does:**
- Creates a new VPC network named `vertex-ai-vpc`
- Uses `custom` subnet mode for full control over IP ranges
- No subnets are created automatically

#### 3.2 Create a Subnet with Private Google Access

**For Training Participants:** Each participant will create their own unique subnet. Use your assigned participant number (1-40) in the commands below.

```bash
# Replace XX with your participant number (01-40)
# For example: participant 1 uses "01", participant 15 uses "15"

gcloud compute networks subnets create vertex-ai-subnet-participant-XX \
--network=vertex-ai-vpc \
--region=us-central1 \
--range=10.10.XX.0/24 \
--enable-private-ip-google-access
```

**Participant IP Range Assignments:**

| Participant | Subnet Name | IP Range | Available IPs |
|------------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 01 | vertex-ai-subnet-participant-01 | 10.10.1.0/24 | 254 |
| 02 | vertex-ai-subnet-participant-02 | 10.10.2.0/24 | 254 |
| 03 | vertex-ai-subnet-participant-03 | 10.10.3.0/24 | 254 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 15 | vertex-ai-subnet-participant-15 | 10.10.15.0/24 | 254 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 40 | vertex-ai-subnet-participant-40 | 10.10.40.0/24 | 254 |

**Example for Participant 7:**
```bash
gcloud compute networks subnets create vertex-ai-subnet-participant-07 \
--network=vertex-ai-vpc \
--region=us-central1 \
--range=10.10.7.0/24 \
--enable-private-ip-google-access
```

**What this does:**
- Creates a unique subnet for each participant in the shared VPC
- Each participant gets their own /24 subnet (254 usable IPs)
- Non-overlapping IP ranges prevent conflicts
- **Enables Private Google Access** - the key setting for this lab!

**Important Notes:**
- The VPC (`vertex-ai-vpc`) is shared by all participants
- Each participant creates and manages their own subnet
- IP ranges are pre-assigned to avoid conflicts
- All subnets have Private Google Access enabled

#### 3.3 Verify Private Google Access

```bash
gcloud compute networks subnets describe vertex-ai-subnet-us-central1 \
--region=us-central1 \
--format="get(privateIpGoogleAccess)"
```

**Expected output:** `True`

This confirms that VMs in this subnet can reach Google APIs without external IPs.

#### 3.4 Configure ML Pipeline to Use Your VPC

### 5. Pipeline Component Access Matrix

| Component | GCS Access | BigQuery Access | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|-------|
| `preprocess_data_op` | Direct | Optional | Uses google-cloud-storage client |
| `train_model_op` | Indirect | Optional | Kubeflow reads/writes model artifacts |
| `evaluate_model_op` | Indirect | Optional | Reads dataset/model, writes metrics |
| `model_approved_op` | Indirect | Optional | Reads model URI for logging |
| `register_model_op` | Indirect | Optional | Reads artifact URI for Model Registry |
| `model_rejected_op` | None | None | Logging only; no GCS/BigQuery interaction |
